# Clean Architecture Registration Project

A clean implementation of a user registration system following Clean Architecture principles. This project serves as a clear, practical example of application structuring with emphasis on separation of concerns and independence from frameworks, databases, and external dependencies.

## Key Architectural Concepts

The project is organized into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities:

### Core Layers
- **Entities**: Contain fundamental business objects and rules (the most stable part)
- **Use Cases (Interactors)**: Application-specific business rules that orchestrate data flow

### Interface Layer
- **Adapters**: Convert data between external formats and internal formats
  - Controllers (handle web requests)
  - Presenters (format output)
  - Gateways (interface with external services)

### Infrastructure Layer
- **Frameworks & Drivers**: Contains implementation details (web framework, database, UI, etc.)
